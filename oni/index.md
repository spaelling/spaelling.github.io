# Oxygen Not Included

Oxygen Not Included is my all time favorite game. This is just a collection of builds and other stuff.

## Build Considerations (WiP)

Whenever I build something, from a complex build like a sour gas boiler to something simple like plotting down a natural gas generator, there are lots of things to consider.

- Placement
- Heat generation
- Gas, liquid and other byproducts
- Power requirements

### Heat

Does the build generate heat? Consider both in the short and long term

- *Crop stiffling* - can happen at low heat output over longer periods
- *Overheating* - from lack of cooling or just long term heat exposure
- *Phase changing* - water turning to steam or crude oil flashing to sour gas
