        <p>By default, when a Management Group gets created, it goes under the Root Management Group, the same is true for Subscriptions.
This works fine, when you have a simple Microsoft Azure environment, but as soon as you start expanding into areas such as Subscription vending or limited access to who can see the Root Management Group and start to look into Visual Studio Enterprise subscriptions, you may want to consider moving new subscriptions, under its own Management Group, away from any policies or RBAC controls, essentially into a Management Group that acts as a shopping cart, to then be picked up and moved later.
If we refer to a recommendation on the Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework:

But as part of troubleshooting this issue, I recreated the Azure compute environment, this user had and started to delve into the Windows logs.
However, in this case I did something a bit different, I exported the logs as text file and opened up Azure OpenAI, then navigated to Azure OpenAI Studio, clicked on Completion and used the summarization powers of the GPT 3.5 Large language model, to delve into the logs for me:

        <p class="published">Published: Tue, 04 Jul 2023 14:15:00 UTC+12:00</p>
        <p>Today, we will look at using Azure OpenAI and ‚ÄòBring Your Data‚Äô to allow recent documentation to be referenced and bring life (and relevance) to your data.

The example we are going to use today is the Microsoft Learn documentation for Microsoft Azure.
Our scenario is this:

We would like to use ChatGPT functionality to query up-to-date information on Microsoft Azure; in this example, we will look for information on Azure Elastic SAN (which was added in late 2022).

When querying ChatGPT for Azure Elastic SAN, we get the following:

Just like the prompt states, ChatGPT only has data up to September 2021 and isn‚Äôt aware of Elastic SAN (or any other changes/updates or new (or retired) services after this date).
So let us use the Azure OpenAI and bring in outside data (ground data), in this case, the Azure document library, to overlay on top of the GPT models, giving the illusion the model is aware of the data.
To do this, we will leverage native ‚ÄòBring Your Own Data‚Äô functionality, now in Azure OpenAI - this is in Public Preview as of 04/07/2023.
To be clear, I don‚Äôt expect you to start downloading from GitHub; this is just an example I have used to add your data</p>

        <p class="published">Published: Mon, 03 Jul 2023 23:00:00 UTC+12:00</p>
        <p>I recently, ran into an error  when attempting to use Azure OpenAI and custom data, in the Chat Playground.
The error I was getting was:

Error
Cannot connect to host aidocsopenaiaccount.openai.azure.com:443 ssl:default [Name of Service not known]
Call to LLM failed.


As I was calling data, that was indexed by Azure Cognitive Search, I thought the index was corrupted or invalid, but after mulitple index attempts, continuted to have the same error, all other prompts (not using my custom data) succeeded.
I recreated the Azure OpenAI service, and was able to succesffuly call the custom data, so started to look at the comparisons between the Azure OpenAI instance, that was working and the Azure OpenAI instance that wasn‚Äôt.
I did this by taking a look at the JSON of each Azure OpenAI instance, then did a comparison, and discovered a major difference.

Note: The one on the left is the working one, the one of the right is the failed one.
The version that was working, had an endpoint of https://*.openai.azure.com , and the version that didn‚Äôt work, had a different endpoint: eastus.api.cognitive.microsoft.com.
You can check the JSON output of a resource, by navigating to it on the Azure Portal, in the Overview Pane, clicking JSON view.

So why would this have been the case?
When I originally created the Azure OpenAI instance that had this issue, I used PowerShell to create the instance:
$skuName = "S0"
$kind = "OpenAI"
# Create Cognitive Services resource
New-AzCognitiveServicesAccount -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroupName -Name $accountName -Location $location -SkuName $skuName -Kind $kind

This seemed to call an older API or different schema.
The version that worked, I created using the Azure Portal - which was correct.
If you run into the same problem, then recreate your Azure OpenAI instance using the Azure Portal, or one of the currently supported methods: Create a resource and deploy a model using Azure OpenAI, currently (as of the 4th of July 2023) PowerShell is not a supported method of creating an Azure OpenAI instance, until the cmdlets have been updated.</p>
