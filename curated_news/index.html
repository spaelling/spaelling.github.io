        <p>When considering build agents to use in Azure DevOps (or GitHub), there are 2 main options to consider:



Agent type
Description




Microsoft-hosted agents
Agents hosted and managed by Microsoft


Self-hosted agents
Agents that you configure and manage, hosted on your VMs



Microsoft-hosted agents, can be used for most things, but there are times where you may need to talk to internal company resources, or security is a concern, which is when you would consider self-hosting the agent yourself.
Here is a table that summarizes the pros and cons of self-hosted Azure DevOps agents and Microsoft-hosted agents:



Agent Type
Pros
Cons




Self-hosted
More control over the environment, ability to install dependent software needed for builds and deployments, machine-level caches and configuration persist from run to run, which can boost speed.
Maintenance and upgrades are not taken care of for you; you must manage the agent yourself.


Microsoft-hosted
Maintenance and upgrades are taken care of for you; each time you run a pipeline, you get a fresh virtual machine discarded after one use</p>

Along with the basics of the Azure Backup solutions, particularly on Virtual Machines running on Microsoft Azure, there have been a lot of changes in the last year, including Immutable vaults, enhanced policies, intelligence tiering, and cross-region restore.
Introduction
Let us start with the basics with a user story; what do we need to achieve:

“As a Cloud Infrastructure Administrator at Contoso, I want to implement an automated backup solution for virtual machines (Windows and Linux) hosted in Microsoft Azure,
So that I can ensure data reliability, disaster recovery, and compliance with minimal manual intervention.”

With some assumptions around further requirements, we can jump into solutions using native Microsoft Azure services to fulfil the Cloud Administrator’s need.
It is worth mentioning, especially around disaster recovery, that there is much more you can (and should do) do around mission-critical Azure architecture</p>

        <p>Working with Azure Bicep using Visual Studio Code, is as native as an experience as you can get, made even better by the Bicep Visual Studio Code extension.
The Bicep Visual Studio Code extension keeps evolving, with a recent (Experimental) feature being added called the Deploy Pane.

The Deployment Pane is a UI panel in VSCode that allows you to connect to your Azure subscription and execute validate, deploy & whatif operations and get instant feedback without leaving the editor.


The Deploy Pane, brings together some key actions:

Deploy
Validate
What-If

The Deploy step, will deploy the Bicep file using the Subscription Scope and ID specified in the pane.
The validate step, will validate that the Bicep syntax is correct for the Azure Resource Manager to process the template.
The What-If step, will let you know what it will deploy and what changes will be made, without having to deploy or touch any resources.
To enable the new Experimental Feature, make sure you are running the latest version of both Bicep, and the Bicep Visual Studio Code extension.

Click on Settings
Expand Extensions
Navigate to: Bicep
Check the box labelled: Experimental: Deploy Pane


Once enabled, you will see the new Deploy Pane, appear in the top right of your Visual Studio code interface, next to Bicep Visualizer, once you have a Bicep file loaded.

If you have any feedback regarding this extension, make sure to add your feedback to the azure/bicep issues</p>

        <p>You can move a Public IP address in Microsoft Azure, to a new Subscription (BUT NOT A DIFFERENT REGION).
There are some limitations as below:

You can’t move a VPN Gateway that is associated with a Standard SKU public IP address to a new subscription.
Azure Public IPs are region specific and can’t be moved from one region to another.

Some resources aren’t supported to be moved, but a Public IP is.
Before you move the Public IP, make sure its dissociated (unattached) from a resource.

Then once dissociated, you can trigger the move.

        <p>By default, when a Management Group gets created, it goes under the Root Management Group, the same is true for Subscriptions.
This works fine, when you have a simple Microsoft Azure environment, but as soon as you start expanding into areas such as Subscription vending or limited access to who can see the Root Management Group and start to look into Visual Studio Enterprise subscriptions, you may want to consider moving new subscriptions, under its own Management Group, away from any policies or RBAC controls, essentially into a Management Group that acts as a shopping cart, to then be picked up and moved later.
If we refer to a recommendation on the Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework:

Configure a default, dedicated management group for new subscriptions</p>

        <p>I was assisting a user on Microsoft Q&A with an issue, that involved looking over some event logs.
The issue itself was related to the Nested Virtualization, with the user unable to install Hyper-V or WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux), it turned out to be incompatilibies with the SKU size and Secure boot.
But as part of troubleshooting this issue, I recreated the Azure compute environment, this user had and started to delve into the Windows logs.
However, in this case I did something a bit different, I exported the logs as text file and opened up Azure OpenAI, then navigated to Azure OpenAI Studio, clicked on Completion and used the summarization powers of the GPT 3.5 Large language model, to delve into the logs for me:

Copying, the Log into the Completion pane of Azure OpenAI
